# Classificiation-of-Fashion-Minst
Aquire the Fashion-MINST dataset, and implement MLP on it to classify the image.
tasks:
1. processing image data
2. implement MLP from scratch
3. Validation to find the relatively better hyperparameters and activation function
4. implement ConvNet from Keras pacakge and compare the accuracy with our MLP
5. try to improve the MLP to get higher prediction accuracy
